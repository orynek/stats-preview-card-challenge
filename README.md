Simple HTML/CSS challenge from Frontendmentor.io

Design mostly focused on using flexbox to position elements. Intresting was to realize how differently browsers are treating CSS filter property. While trying to add color layer over image using combination of "drop-shadow" and "opacity" values it turned out that Firefox understands that differently than Chrome. In the end I had to place image in separate container to achieve same effect on all browsers.

Another day, another experience. Commiting as to motivate myself for improvement.
